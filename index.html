                The Rocinante ("Roci") is a former MCRN (Martian Congressional Republic Navy)-turned-independent
                Corvette-class frigate capable of multiple combat roles, including acting as a torpedo bomber
                and marine insertion vessel. Originally commissioned as the MCRN Tachi (ECF-270), the ship
                was stationed aboard the flagship of the Martian navy, the MCRN Donnager. It was renamed by
                James Holden after he and his crew escaped the Donnager aboard the ship, marking the start of
                its long and decorated career as an independent warship.
