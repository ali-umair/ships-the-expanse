             <p>
                The Expanse takes place hundreds of years in the future, things are different than what 
                humanity is used to after humans have colonized the solar system and Mars has become an 
                independent military power. Rising tensions between Earth and Mars have put them on the 
                brink of war.

                The Rocinante ("Roci") is a former MCRN (Martian Congressional Republic Navy)-turned-independent
                Corvette-class frigate capable of multiple combat roles, including acting as a torpedo bomber
                and marine insertion vessel. Originally commissioned as the MCRN Tachi (ECF-270), the ship
                was stationed aboard the flagship of the Martian navy, the MCRN Donnager.

            <h4>Generational colony ship</h4>
            <p class="ship-description">
                The LDSS Nauvoo, later known as OPAS Behemoth and then Medina Station, is a generation ship 
                constructed at Tycho Station. Cylindrical in shape, it measured just over two kilometers 
                long and half a kilometer wide. Four Donnager-class battleships would fit in her belly and 
                not touch the walls.

                Jupiter fleet. The Donnager is the namesake of the Donnager-class Battleship.
                Destroyed before the Ganymede incident, it played a highly active role in protecting 
                Martian shipping lanes, shutting down piracy, and protecting Martian interests in the 
                outer Solar system.

            <p class="ship-description">
                The Canterbury ("Cant") was a former colony ship which was converted to function as an 
                ice hauler traveling among the Belt and Outer Planets in service of the Pur'n'Kleen 
                Water Company.The defenseless ship was destroyed in an ambush by the stealth corvette 
                Anubis while investigating the distress beacon of the Scopuli. Only five crewmembers 
                survived thanks to being aboard the shuttle Knight which was a safe distance from the 
                reactor breach initiated by the Anubis's nuclear assault.
